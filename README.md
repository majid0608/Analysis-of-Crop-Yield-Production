# Comparative Analysis of Crop Yield Production Using 3 Different ML Algorithms

## Project Description
This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms to predict crop yields using historical agricultural data. By leveraging data on temperature, rainfall, and crop production, the study aims to develop reliable predictive models that can forecast agricultural yields at both state and national levels in India.

## Objective
The primary objective of this research is to develop reliable predictive models capable of forecasting agricultural yields before harvest, thereby aiding policy makers and farmers in making informed decisions.

## Methodology
- *Data Collection:* Comprehensive data collection on temperature, rainfall, and crop production across various states and at the national level in India.
- *Data Preprocessing:* Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* EDA to uncover patterns and correlations using visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- *Machine Learning Algorithms:* 
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Gradient Boosting Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
- *Model Evaluation Metrics:* RMSE, R-squared, MAE, Maximum Error.

## Implementation
- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- *Tools:* Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

## Results
- *Predictive Model Outcomes:* Promising levels of accuracy in crop yield predictions.
- *Significance of Weather Variables:* Identified temperature and rainfall as crucial factors influencing crop yields.
- *Regional Variations:* Highlighted the need for region-specific forecasting models.

## Conclusion
This study demonstrates the efficacy of machine learning techniques in estimating crop productivity, providing valuable insights for optimizing resource allocation and enhancing agricultural planning and decision-making processes.
